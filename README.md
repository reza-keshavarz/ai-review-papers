# Artificial Intelligence Review Papers

To tackle any new subject in the academic world, it's always a good idea to start with review papers. However, finding reliable review paper in the desired topic is not always easy.

This repo aims to provide a list of high-quality review papers in different fields of research in AI academia.

**This repo is not complete yet, an will never be :)**

New papers will be added continuously, to make this an always-update source for researchers.

Feel free to suggest the good papers you encounter by opening an issue.
